**Storybook**

- Split out decorators into individual files for better maintainability
- Pulled out modes and types into distinct folders to make it easier to find and update them
- Used imports for all new assets into the preview.js to maintain a single-source-of-truth for assets

**Generator**

- Updated to remove globals example from the Storybook boilerplate
